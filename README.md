# UFOs

## Overview of UFOs

In this project we used JavaScript and HTML created a dynamic webpage that can be filtered by user input based on the table that contains UFO data stored as a JavaScript array or list. 

In order to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, we are going to add table filters for the city, state, county and shape addition to the date. 

## Results

After applying all the JavaScript and HTML scripts, the initial page of the UFO Sightings is available:

Users could filter the table on the right side of the page by entering inputs in each of the filter items in the “Filter Search” section on the left. Users could filter by all filters, or some of the filters. 

1.	Filtered by all filters:

## Summary

This dynamic webpage allows users to enter inputs to filter the UFOs table. However, if the user does not familiar with the UFOs table in this webpage, it is hard for the user to enter information. There are few improvements that could apply to this webpage to make it more user friendly.

1.	Add a drop-down list for each of the filter items on the left. This will help users to better understand the UFOs data in this webpage and easier for users to filter the data.

2.	There are many webpages for UFO facts and investigations. For users that interested in this topic, we could add additional links that could direct the users to other webpages for more information.
